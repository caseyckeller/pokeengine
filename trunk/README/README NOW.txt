It seems that a certain person has been taking our source code, and creating a game out of it.

Normally, I wouldn't have a problem with this, except that it's 'TheGreatnickInTheSky' who's doing this
for his shitty game. You may remember him from various IRC conversations like this one- http://pastebin.com/uLjvbS3u

tl;dr, he came in, with no intention of helping, and tried stealing our programmers. Everybody turned 
him down, so he became butthurt. 

Anyways, today I found this post on PC- http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?p=6372558 - he's made substantial
progress since our last encounter, and I have reasons to believe that is because he's using our code.

tl;dr Because he's using our code, I deleted everything.

PS- don't worry, I backed it up! I stuck it in a .7z file that's on my desktop. When we figure out somewhere else
to host our code, I'll be more than happy to upload it and set stuff up. And this time, we'll WAIT until we release
1.0 to release our source code UNDER AN OPEN SOURCE LICENSE.

PSS- If you're reading this GreatNickInTheSky, it is NOT cool to use our code without at least giving us credit.
Please kindly die in a fire.
